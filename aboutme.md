# Allen Kim’s AboutMe

Hi, I’m Allen. I’m currently a Director of Product at Shippo. This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially in a remote-first work environment with folks who haven’t worked with me before.

It’s also a well-intended effort at building some trust by being intentionally open, vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.


## About Me
I was born in Ann Arbor, MI and grew up there until I was 7 years old. When my dad finished his Ph.D at U of M in Philosophy, our whole family moved to S. Korea.
I spent most of my childhood in S. Korea attending public schools. At the end of my 8th grade summer, my parents had a revelation that we (me and my younger sister) should have our education in the U.S. and decided to move back to Ann Arbor MI! High school was when I learned how to read, write, speak, and comprehend English and took English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.
I’ve been living in the U.S. ever since! Here are a few fun facts about me.

* I live in Irvine, CA with my lovely wife and 1 year old son Elliott (born in ‘20).
* I love to cycle 2 to 3 times a week for ~30 miles around the area. It’s how I do my deep thinking and get unstuck on hard problems.
* I try to listen first before acting and always listen deeply. I hope to be fully present in every conversation so I can develop deep empathy for people and their challenges.
* I have many strong opinions (as I believe it’s one of core PM skills), but they’re weakly held. I love finding a new perspective that makes me change my opinion, because it means that I’ve gotten a chance to learn something substantive and new.
* I’m a passionate and energetic person that loves the craft of product management and invest time and resources to perfecting it.
* I’m a naturally curious person who loves to learn and put those learnings into action.
* I still struggle with imposter syndrome.

## Values that are extremely important to me
* **Integrity**: Ben Horowitz’s second book *What You Do Is Who You Are* resonates deeply with what I believe. Team culture isn’t aspirational corporate values or company perks. It’s who you are and how you show up for others everyday. Be open, honest, and use your moral compass in times of making hard decisions.
* **Team first**: I struggled with humility in my professional career. Receiving awards and accolades, being promoted for my work, and helping companies set new strategic directions sometimes made me believe I was special and deserve all the credit. Thankfully I had friends and mentors along my journey to coach me through these moments. Truth is, I feel enormously privileged and lucky to be doing what I do and love what I do. Buliding products is fundamentally a team sport. You cannot succeed in achieving a business objective/goal without the help of others. Over index on communicating, be patience with your teammates, be thoughtful and empathetic in disagreements, hold yourself and others accountable for their work, and trust one another. If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.
* **Intellectual curiosity & work ethic**: To make Shippo a world-class product company, we need people who are naturally curious and seek to learn continuously. Hard working doesn’t mean working overtime. It’s applying the product management framework in your own life to identify how you can bring your best work and productivity in the limited time you have.

## 360 Feedback
In the spirit of transparency, I’ll share a summary of 360 feedback from June 2020 in a previous role:

## Things I’m working on
Being new to Shippo, I’ll be working on the 4 areas below during my first 90 days: people, process, product, and strategy. 
* People: I’m planning on investing a lot of my time getting to know my team, various stakeholders in Shippo, and our customers. 
* Process: I’d like to get a pulse for team culture/health around how the team conduct product discovery and delivery. Are we practicing good hygiene to understand customer problems and come up with solutions?
* Product: In-depth review of our current product, how our customers use our product, and where things fall short.
* Strategy: Develop a compelling merchant experience product strategy that helps us focus on where to execute and why.

## My role as Director of Product
If you’re on my team, I’m here to support you, provide focus and clarity on our most important problems, and to advocate for you and the things you ship. I serve you, and we should optimize the things we do together for the organization. First and foremost, I’m here to help you shine by enabling your success in your current role. I hope to do this in a few ways:

* **Provide you with context**. What’s our team’s overall strategy and vision? How would your current role fit in the overall picture? I do a lot of communicating with people you might not communicate frequently, and I hope to shield you from things that aren’t as important and provide you with clarity on the things that are.
* **Thought partner with you on problems**. You’ll know your area of the product better than anyone else in the company, but I’ll be close enough to have some informed thoughts of my own to partner with you to help you succeed.
* **Help you directly whenever you need it**. I love hearing “I could really use help with…”. Ideally, we can prevent stress and burnout from happening at all at work. But when things get stuck or need an extra mind to work through a problem you’re dealing with, I’ll always pick up a hose and firefight with you if needed if you provide that space for me. I also want to be an avid supporter of your career path. Your career belongs to you, and I want to cheerlead and support you on your path.
* **Evangelize your success and watch you shine**. I’ll do my best to celebrate your wins.
* **Expose you to opportunities that allow you to grow and learn** and encourage you to seize them. I don’t want you to be bored!

## How you can help me
* On boarding: Help me understand the industry, customers, user journey, jobs to be done, competitors, 5-10x growth opportunities, your product area, and more. I’d like to soak up as much knowledge and information as possible.
* Do thoughtful, good work. Tell me if there’s something preventing you from doing this, and we’ll work together to address it.
* Bias to action. Beauty of product management is that there’s no one single solution. Instead of waiting, move problems forward with creative ways.
* Communicate. If there’s a problem, please bring it up. I generally interpret silence as “things are fine”. Don’t save urgent matters for 1:1. 
* I like explicit and specific asks. I’m better at helping when I have a good idea of what you need. “Take a look” is less helpful than “I’m looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of this week”. 
* Bring your whole self to work.
